### Open Projects & Theses

I offer student projects and theses in X‑ray Gaussian Splatting, synthetic‑to‑real X‑ray domain adaptation, and related areas.
If you are interested in contributing to novel 3D reconstruction methods, domain transfer techniques, or experimental imaging pipelines, feel free to reach out for more details.
