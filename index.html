<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm Florian Eberhardt, a computer vision researcher at Prof. Ben Busam’s Lab for Photogrammetry 
and Remote Sensing at the Technical University of Munich. My research lies at the intersection of 
computer vision, photogrammetry, and industrial applications, with a focus on integrating computer vision, 
AI, and photogrammetry into the core of automation, industrial quality control, and IIoT.
</p>

<h2>Current Research</h2>

<p>My current research includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3D deformable mesh reconstruction from binocular images</li>
  <li>Pose estimation in X-ray images</li>
  <li>Synthetic data generation for training deep learning models</li>
  <li>Synthetic-to-real domain adaptation for X-ray imaging</li>
  <li>AI agents for industrial service applications</li>
</ul>


<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>I am involved in teaching, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Photogrammetry Selected Chapters</li>
  <li>Project Photogrammetry</li>
  <li>Photogrammetry Practical</li> 
</ul>
